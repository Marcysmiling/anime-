                     Though stereotypes might reduce women in anime to one-dimensional love interests, the truth is that women in anime are just as diverse as their male counterparts. Though shojo anime is always a great source of female characters, even shonen anime has its share of interesting women. Great female characters can be found in every genre of anime, making ranking the best difficult. In a way, the best female anime characters can almost be considered a reflection of the industry as a whole.</p>
